# About the chapters
- The topic is divided in chapter
- Since I don't know for sure what will happen, today I have 15 chapters numbered from 010 to 150
- Doing so, if at one point I need to insert more chapters I can name them 015 and 016 for example.
- I will not hesitate to reorder the chapters if I really need.

# About the setup
- Windows 10
- My Microsoft compiler is usually up to date. Today (May, 9 2017) it is described as : C/C++ versionÂ 19.14.26428.1 for x64
- VS Code to edit and build the code snippet. I don't use Visual Studio because the code consist of one single file. I wanted to keep the setup as light as possible (yes, I know Visual Studio can work without project nor Solution)
- All the code target x64 and is compiled with std=c++17
- If you have another IDE, you should be able to copy and paste the C++ code and compile it. In worst case 
- You may be interrested in readng this page : https://www.40tude.fr/blog/how-to-compile-cpp-code-with-vscode-cl/

# About the source code
- Each chapter consist of a single source code
- Each source code consist of one or more code section
- Each section is physically separated from the previous one by at least 10 lines
- Only one section can be active at one time otherwise the source contains 2 main() functions and it cannot be built. 
- So... Get prepareed to use / and * or to use CTRL+(K, C) and CTRL+(K, U) to comment and uncomment sections of code
- Each code section is autonomous. This means that each uncommented section can be compile and build on its own. 
- Each code section contains a fair amount of comments
- These comments usually starts at row 81 (moderns screen and today resolution allow such setup)
- When needed, each comment starts with a number. In this case read the comments following the numbers in increasing order. 
- While progressing along the main.cpp file, if one section of code is an improvment of the previous one then we avoid to repeat the same comments in order to ease the reading of the new section.

# About the process
## If you use VS code and cl
1. Open a developper console
2. Reach the directory of the chapter you're interrested in
3. In the command line type : code . (don't forget the dot)
4. Open the file main.cpp
5. CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the code
6. SHIFT+F5 to run the debug version
7. Come back the the source and read the comments
8. Set breakpoints, debug and trace the code again and again. Ideally you should not need any console output. The debugger is your friend.
8. Copy/paste, modify, improve the code. Accumulate experience even if to do so you have to break everything :-)  

## If you don't use cl but use VS Code
1. Open VS Code
2. Open the folder of interrest (CTRL+K, CTRL+O)
4. Open the file main.cpp
3. Open and adapt the tasks.json file
4. Open and adapt the launch.json
5. CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the code
6. SHIFT+F5 to run the debug version
7. Come back to the source and read the comments
8. Set breakpoints, debug and trace the code again and again. Ideally you should not need any console output. The debugger is your friend.
8. Copy/paste, modify, improve the code. Accumulate experience even if to do so you have to break everything :-)  

## If you don't use cl nor VS Code
1. Reach the folder of interrest 
2. Copy the file main.cpp
3. Past it in your favorite toolchain
4. Build the code
5. Run the debug version
6. Come back to the source and read the comments
7. Set breakpoints, debug and trace the code again and again. Ideally you should not need any console output. The debugger is your friend.
8. Copy/paste, modify, improve the code. Accumulate experience even if to do so you have to break everything :-)
